A lot of our plugins require certain permissions to function correctly. This guide will show you how to enable these permissions.

Permissions in Roblox Studio are controlled via the Manage Plugins window.

## Enabling Plugin Permissions

First you need to open the manage plugins window. You can do this by going to `Plugins` -> `Manage Plugins`.

Next, you will need to find the plugin you want to enable permissions for. 

Then click below the plugin description where it says "Script Injection Denied".

The window will change to a settings menu where you can enable all required permissions.

Please ensure you enable both HTTP requests and Script Injection.
